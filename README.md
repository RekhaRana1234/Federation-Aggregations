## Non Federated learning
- Simple RNN based machine learning modeling is performed without federated learning inclusion.

- Federated Proxy
- Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD)

## Privacy Preserving Aggregators
- Federated learning with Differential Privacy
- Federated learning with Homomorphic encryption

## Robust Aggregators
