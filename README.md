## Non Federated learning
- Simple RNN based machine learning modeling is performed without federated learning inclusion.


## Normal Aggregators
- Federated Average (FedAvg)
- Federated Proxy (FedProx)
- Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD)

## Privacy Preserving Aggregators
- Federated learning with Differential Privacy (FL-DP)
- Federated learning with Homomorphic encryption (FL-HE)

## Robust Aggregators
- Trimmed Mean
- Median
- Multi-Kurm
